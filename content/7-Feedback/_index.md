## Feedback on FCJ Workforce Program Experience

Throughout the 12-week **FCJ Workforce** program, I have gained invaluable experience in a professional work environment, continuous learning culture, and practical Cloud Computing skill development opportunities.

---

### 1. Overall Program Evaluation

**Outstanding Strengths**

**Professional and Friendly Work Environment**  
The work environment at FCJ is both professional and welcoming, providing the best conditions for intern development. The learning through practice culture is applied throughout, helping me not only learn theory but also practice directly on real projects. The workspace is modern, fully equipped with necessary AWS tools and resources.

**Active Learning Community**  
Participating in the AWS Cloud Clubs Vietnam community is one of the program's greatest strengths. I had opportunities to connect with other interns, exchange experiences, and learn from each other. Weekly knowledge sharing sessions are very beneficial.

### 2. Support from Mentors and Admin Team

**Mentors**

My mentor has deep AWS expertise and rich practical experience. What I appreciate most:

- **Effective Guidance Approach**: Instead of providing immediate answers, my mentor encourages me to research, debug, and find solutions independently. When facing difficulties, they guide me on how to approach problems rather than solving them for me.

- **Real-world Experience Sharing**: My mentor frequently shares case studies from actual projects, helping me understand how to apply knowledge in production environments.

**Admin Team**

The admin team provides excellent support for:
- Organizing workshops, seminars, and networking events
- Answering questions about company processes and policies
- Flexible time support when balancing work with studies

### 3. Alignment with Major and Career Goals

**Academic Alignment**

With a Computer Science or Information Technology background, the FCJ program perfectly aligns with what I learned:
- Knowledge of networking, operating systems, and databases is directly applied to AWS services
- Programming skills are used to build serverless applications and automation scripts
- Knowledge of data structures and algorithms helps me optimize cloud architecture

**New Skills Expansion**

The program not only reinforces foundational knowledge but also exposes me to many new technologies:
- Cloud-native technologies: Docker, Kubernetes, ECS, EKS
- Infrastructure as Code: CloudFormation, Terraform, AWS CDK
- DevOps practices: CI/CD pipelines, observability
- Generative AI and machine learning: Amazon Bedrock, SageMaker, RAG architecture
- Security best practices: IAM, GuardDuty, Security Hub, compliance frameworks
