# Summary Report: Vietnam Cloud Day 2025 – HCMC Connect Edition (Track 1: GenAI & Data)

### Event Objectives

- **Understand security mindset**: Learn methods to protect enterprises from emerging risks in the GenAI and AI Agents era
- **Explore new development processes**: Study the AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) model to modernize workflows
- **Optimize data foundation**: Learn to build unified data architecture (Unified Data Foundation) for Analytics and AI
- **Update strategy**: Grasp the latest GenAI trends and technology roadmap from AWS

### Speakers

- **Jun Kai Loke** – AI/ML Specialist SA, AWS
- **Kien Nguyen** – Solutions Architect, AWS
- **Tamelly Lim** – Storage Specialist SA, AWS
- **Binh Tran** – Senior Solutions Architect, AWS
- **Taiki Dang** – Solutions Architect, AWS
- **Michael Armentano** – Principal WW GTM Specialist, AWS

### Key Highlights

#### Building Unified Data Foundation (Unified Data Platform)

- **Comprehensive data processing workflow (End-to-end)**: From ingestion, storage, processing to access and governance
- **Solving the "Data Silo" problem**: Breaking down barriers between departments and processes, moving toward Self-service model with strict Governance
- **Core service ecosystem**: Combining S3, Glue, Redshift, Lake Formation, OpenSearch, and Kinesis/MSK

#### GenAI Deployment Strategy on AWS

- Vision direction and practical GenAI application roadmap
- **Amazon Bedrock**: Optimizing model selection, RAG deployment, and cost/latency control
- **Expanding capabilities with AgentCore & Amazon Nova**: Flexible integration with popular frameworks like CrewAI, LangGraph, LlamaIndex

#### Multi-layered Security for GenAI Applications

- Identifying risks according to OWASP LLM standards and establishing security barriers from infrastructure, model to application layer
- **5 core security pillars**: Compliance, Privacy, Controls, Risk Management, and Resilience
- **Supporting tools**: Bedrock Guardrails, Human-in-the-loop mechanism, and comprehensive monitoring (Observability)

#### Accelerating Productivity with AI Agents

- Transitioning from simple virtual assistants to Multi-agent systems, minimizing manual intervention
- **Case study**: Applications in customer care and Business Intelligence (BI) through Amazon Q in QuickSight

#### Ensuring Model Accuracy and Reliability

- Overcoming Hallucination phenomenon through Prompt Engineering, RAG, and Fine-tuning techniques
- **RAG processing flow**: Input → Embedding → Context Retrieval → LLM Processing → Output

#### AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC)

- **Development phases**: Inception → Construction → Operation
- **Evolution of AI's role**: From Support (AI-Assisted) → Direction (AI-Driven) → Management (AI-Managed)
- **Implementation through**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC), automated testing, and proactive risk management

#### Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio

- Unified workspace for Data Engineering, Analytics, and AI
- Strong Lakehouse support and Zero-ETL data integration (between S3 and sources like Redshift, Aurora, DynamoDB)
- **Comprehensive MLOps workflow**: From pipelines, registry to deployment and monitoring  

### Key Takeaways

#### Systems Design Mindset

- Transitioning to End-to-end design thinking, focusing on eliminating bottlenecks (silos) in data flow
- Understanding the importance of establishing Governance rules alongside Self-service capabilities

#### Technical Architecture

- Ability to seamlessly integrate AWS services (S3, Glue, SageMaker, Bedrock) to create a solid platform
- Recognizing the role of Zero-ETL and Lakehouse in ensuring scalability and sustainable operations
- How to use AI Agents and frameworks to automate complex tasks

#### Deployment Strategy

- Need to build clear GenAI roadmap, balancing innovation and cost considerations
- Security is not an add-on feature but a foundation (infrastructure, model, app) combined with human element (Human-in-the-loop)
- AI output quality depends heavily on RAG techniques and Prompt Engineering

#### Modern Software Development Mindset

- Shift in working model: AI is not just supporting but gradually participating in process management (AI-Managed)
- AI-DLC is the standardized framework for development teams to collaborate effectively with artificial intelligence  

### Applying to Work

#### For real-world projects:

- Pilot AI Agent to automate registration flow and support user inquiries
- Set up Guardrails to filter input/output content, ensuring GenAI application safety

#### In team activities (Teamwork):

- Apply AI-DLC model: Use AI to create code base and documentation, team focuses on reviewing logic and making decisions
- Clearly analyze use-cases to choose between Serverless (Lambda) and Container (ECS/Fargate) to optimize costs

#### Personal development direction:

- Practice Business-first mindset: Always put business problems first before choosing technology solutions
- Focus on strengthening Data Foundation knowledge as this is the "raw material" that determines GenAI success

### Event Experience

Attending **"Vietnam Cloud Day 2025"** provided me with profound and practical insights into the current technology landscape, especially the intersection between Data and GenAI. Below are the highlights of my experience:

#### Expert perspectives
- Listened to AWS experts deeply analyze Data Foundation and Security - the crucial icebergs beneath AI's glamorous surface
- Better understanding of the Unified Data Platform concept, helping me visualize how a standard data system operates
- Strongly impressed by the vision of Multi-agent Systems, opening new directions for enterprise automation

#### Hands-on experience
- Observed complete data pipeline process: From raw data ingestion to governance and utilization
- Direct exposure to advanced tools like Amazon Bedrock and SageMaker Unified Studio
- Witnessed the practical effectiveness of Hallucination handling techniques (RAG, Prompt Engineering)
- Understood how to divide work between Humans and AI through the AI-DLC model

#### Exploring new technologies
- Recognized the necessity of Bedrock Guardrails in controlling AI content risks
- Clearly distinguished pros/cons between AWS Lambda and ECS/Fargate in specific scenarios
- Discovered the power of Amazon Q in supporting Business Intelligence (QuickSight)

#### Networking and Lessons
- The event was a valuable opportunity to discuss with the Builders community, learning from both successful and failed case studies
- **Biggest lesson**: GenAI needs proper strategy and clean data foundation. Without Data and Security, AI is just an empty tool
- AI-DLC and Agents will be the future of software development, requiring programmers to adapt and upgrade AI management skills  



> Overall, the event not only provided technical knowledge but also helped me reshape my thinking about application design, system modernization, and cross-team collaboration.
