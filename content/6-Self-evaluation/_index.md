During my cloud engineering journey from **08/09/2025** to **01/12/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, apply, and strengthen a wide range of technical and professional skills in a structured, real-world cloud environment.

Throughout this period, I participated in multiple hands-on activities such as:

* Building foundational AWS infrastructure (IAM, VPC, EC2, S3, EBS, EFS…)
* Designing high-availability architectures (ELB, ASG, RDS Multi-AZ, CloudFront)
* Working with managed databases (RDS, DynamoDB, Aurora)
* Implementing application modernization (ECS, Fargate, EKS, KOPS, Minikube)
* Building and optimizing CI/CD pipelines (Git Flow, Jenkins, CodePipeline)
* Implementing observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, Helios)
* Working with serverless architectures (Lambda, API Gateway, Step Functions)
* Building data and ML pipelines (Glue, Athena, QuickSight, SageMaker)

Through these tasks, I improved significantly in cloud architecture, DevOps, automation, debugging, monitoring, communication, and overall engineering professionalism.

I always strived to complete tasks with quality, maintained discipline, and collaborated effectively with teammates during all technical hands-on weeks.

### Needs Improvement

* Improve discipline and consistency in documentation and reporting during weeks with heavy workloads
* Enhance communication clarity, especially when explaining complex architecture or troubleshooting steps to non-technical members
* Strengthen problem-solving depth for advanced debugging (Kubernetes networking, multi-cluster management, CI/CD failures)

### Summary

Overall, the internship/study journey significantly improved my technical competencies in:

* **Cloud architecture (AWS)** - VPC, EC2, ELB, ASG, Route 53, CloudFront
* **DevOps tools** - Git Flow, Jenkins, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy
* **Kubernetes ecosystem** - Minikube, KOPS, Deployments, Services, Ingress
* **Observability & Monitoring** - Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, Helios, CloudWatch
* **CI/CD & automation** - Jenkins pipelines, AWS native CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code
* **Data & AI/ML services** - Glue, Athena, QuickSight, SageMaker

I have transitioned from foundational knowledge to practical, hands-on, production-level cloud engineering skills, preparing me for real enterprise environments and future certifications (AWS SAA, DVA, DevOps Engineer, CKA).
